# Firestarter

![](static/fire.png)

Firestarter is a simple Parcel-bundler based starter kit, geared towards building PWAs. 

It provides a sturdy starting point for sketching up web interfaces without much more paperwork than simply getting a copy of it. 

Comes out of the box with `parcel-plugin-static-files-copy`, `SASS` support and an easily extensible, if a bit primitive service worker, making the default starting point already an installable PWA. 

## Getting it

To download, [click on this link](https://github.com/groundhogs/firestarter/archive/v1.0.0.zip). Releases are launched periodically, only major versions are ever going to be linked here; visit [the releases page](https://github.com/groundhogs/firestarter/releases) instead to get the latest releases there are.

## Scripts

* `yarn develop` gives you a hot-reloading, live coding environment and 
* `yarn build` bundles what you just built into a standalone static site

Add your own scripts here!

## Contributing

The thing is already mighty small, but any contributions are super welcome.
